> [!WARNING]

>
> Maintenance mode means:
>
> * this project is **not accepting new features, components, or significant enhancements.**
> * the Primer team at GitHub will continue providing:

The Primer team continues to focus its resources on strategic investments that help GitHub and its customers to be successful, while making developers’ lives easier. The Primer design system remains a part of this vision through [guidance](https://primer.style/product/ui-patterns/), [tooling](https://primer.style/product/getting-started/react/), and ready-to-use [React](https://primer.style/product/components/) and [web components](https://github.com/github/github-elements).
>
> We encourage internal GitHub consumers to plan to migrate from Primer ViewComponents to [Primer React](https://github.com/primer/react).
>
> Non-GitHub consumers should consider forking and maintaining a copy of this repo.
>
> Questions may be posted on the [maintenance mode announcement](https://github.com/primer/view_components/discussions/3908). Thank you for your support and interest!
